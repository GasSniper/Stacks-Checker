💥 Have you heard about the STACKS airdrop in 2021⁉️

 Introducing Stacks Checker – Find Your Hidden Stacks Airdrop! 

ℹ️ What is it?
Stacks Checker is a powerful tool to scan your old #seed phrases and uncover Stacks (#STX) tokens from the 2021 Stacks Airdrop! Back in 2021, #Stacks distributed 100–1000 STX per wallet, and with 1 STX now valued at nearly $1 (based on current market data from CoinMarketCap as of May 2025), that’s a potential windfall! ☄️ However, many don’t realize these tokens aren’t visible in popular wallets like MetaMask—you need specific wallets like Xverse to see them.

👀 Who needs it?
Anyone with seed phrases from before 2021!
Crypto enthusiasts who might have missed the #Airdrop.
People curious about unclaimed assets—thousands of wallets still hold untouched STX because users aren’t aware! 💰

🔍 What can it do?
✔️Generates Stacks addresses from your seed phrases.
✔️Checks balances and transaction history.
✔️Processes ~1 seed phrase per second! ⚡️
✔️Saves results to Good.txt and errors to Errors.txt for easy review.

🕯 Why check now?
If you have old seed phrases, there’s a high chance they contain Stacks from the 2021 Airdrop. Many wallets remain unclaimed, and the tokens are just sitting there waiting to be discovered. Don’t miss out—check your old phrases today, you might find a surprise! 🏆
